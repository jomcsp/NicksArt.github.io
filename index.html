                                                        <p>I've always enjoyed learning and challenging myself. I chose to double major in Applied Mathematics and Physics, not because it was easy, but because it was hard. Doing the double major has taken a lot of motivation and dedication. While I’ve done very well in school, it came with a lot of effort. In many of my classes at UNC, the professors have emphasized self directed learning to supplement the material covered in class. Putting in the extra time and effort is part of what has helped me succeed in my undergraduate studies. The habit of hard work I’ve been able to develop will serve me well in graduate school as I continue my education.</p>
                                                        <p>This past summer I participated in an internship program at SR Technologies. During that time I was able to do mathematical modeling where I worked on merging the information between multiple disjoint data sets. At the end of my time there, I had developed a new method for merging probability ellipses that is currently progressing through the patent process. I’ve begun taking some graduate courses at UNC and I believe this will prepare me well for the next level at MSU. I hope to one day make a change in the world.  I hope to see my future in my work and life through math.  Making a difference in the world, one problem at a time, line by line</p>

                                                    <h1>Before College</h1>
                                                    <p>When I look at my bookshelf, I see many math and physics books from the classes I’ve taken over the years. And while there is no question I’m a “math guy”, there is so much beyond school that makes me the person I am today. Earlier I mentioned about how UNC emphasized the importance of working hard, but in reality I learned that lesson long before I came to college. When I was in elementary school, I was diagnosed with Dysedesia, a visual form of dyslexia, which made reading, writing, and even math a great struggle. Dealing with this disability has had a profound affect on my life. It showed me from a young age life isn’t about the challenges you face, but about how you face them.</p>
                                                    <p>In 2018, life presented me with another great struggle; a seemingly normal school day ended in gunfire as 17 of my fellow classmates and teachers were killed in the Parkland School Shooting. The loss of my cross-country coach was one felt not only by my fellow teammates, but by the entire neighborhood. In the following days, I led my team to put on a large community event in memory of the lives lost. People from all around the world ran with us on that afternoon. This memory serves as a constant reminder to make the most of every day, and that when we face adversity head on, great things can be accomplished.</p>
