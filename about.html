                <p>When I grew up I loved adventure and creativity. Much of what I have been able to  experience I enjoy displaying in my artwork. The adventurous side of me, keeps me pushing further, always exploring new mediums.</p>
                <p>I began draeing when I was young in school and from there I branched out to other mediums. When I was 6years old I had gone to visit my grandmother. She would always crochet while watching tv, and so I asked her to teach me. Over the years Ive continued
                    to crochet and it has continued to grow as one of my passions. During one summer I took a painting class with my family. I found that I enjoyed painting as much as the other styles and continue to explore it. As a freshman at UNC I took a class exploring the relationships between the
                folding of paper and the folding of proteins. While learning the science behind folding origami is interesting, I found it to be a great medium for expressing myself.  </p>
                <p>In highschool I was apart of a competitive culinary team, making fine dining quizine and competing throughout the state of Florida. Culinary has become one of the many ways to let my creative side shine through. Our most acclaimed award wining dish was creamed corn and scallops as a starter.
                    It featured a bed of corn combined with cajun seasoning and bell peppers topped with sea scallops and microgreens. Our main dish was confit de canard with a thyme and berry reduction and rasted fingerling potatoe medaly. Finally, our third course was a bannanas foster beignet.
